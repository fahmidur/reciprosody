## Welcome to Reciprosody

Reciprosody is an open repository of prosodically annotated speech.

Currently, prosody researchers lack a simple way to share their annotated data. This lack:

* limits our ability to test robust supervised techniques for automatic prosody detection
* makes it difficult to compare performance across publications that operate on private corpora 
* puts the burden on the creators of a resource to maintain and distribute their data. 

The lack of shareable data is particularly worrisome in our field, since prosodic annotation, as we all know, is a very onerous and time-consuming task.
