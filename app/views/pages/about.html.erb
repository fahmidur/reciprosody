		<p>Reciprosody is an open repository of prosodically annotated speech.</p>
		<p>
		Currently, prosody researchers lack a simple way to share their annotated data. This lack: 
		<span class='badge badge-info'>1</span> limits our ability to test robust supervised techniques for automatic prosody detection; 
		<span class='badge badge-info'>2</span> makes it difficult to compare performance across publications that operate on private corpora; 
		and <span class='badge badge-info'>3</span> puts the burden on the creators of a resource to maintain and distribute their data. 
		The lack of shareable data is particularly worrisome in our field, since prosodic annotation, 
		as we all know, is a very onerous and time-consuming task.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		We have developed a way to address these issues, 
		by making it easy for individuals and groups to share prosodically annotated data, 
		for any language and using any annotation scheme. 
		Reciprosody serves to simplify the dissemination process for corpus owners, 
		while simplifying the process of locating material for researchers. 
		Corpora of all sizes, using any annotation standard, in any language are welcome.

			<p>
				Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel investigates the cognitive structures and processes involved in speech production planning, particularly at the level of speech sound sequencing. Her work with speech error patterns and with the acoustic analyses of prosody has implications for cognitive models of speech production and for phonological theory, as well as applications in speech recognition and synthesis.
